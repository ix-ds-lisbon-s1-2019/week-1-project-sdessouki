# ix-lisbon-project-week-1

Here is the link to my blog: sdessouki.github.io

Here is the repo with the project brief and where you should push your final poker game .py file. Might be a good idea to edit this README to include a link to your blog (where in a post you should link this repo too) :) 

The deadline is **tomorrow (Friday) the 31st of May at 8pm**.

Blog is live and great, except it is missing an explanation of how your poker_game.py file works.

The poker game executes, but it appears there is a bug that is duplicating hands for players:

```
Number of players: 4


Player 1's hand: [ hearts 4,  hearts 10,  diamonds 8,  clubs 7,  diamonds 4], [ diamonds 6,  diamonds 3,  clubs 14,  spades 13,  hearts 5], [ clubs 6,  clubs 3,  diamonds 10,  spades 4,  hearts 2], [ diamonds 9,  spades 11,  hearts 6,  clubs 9,  hearts 14],
Player 2's hand: [ hearts 4,  hearts 10,  diamonds 8,  clubs 7,  diamonds 4], [ diamonds 6,  diamonds 3,  clubs 14,  spades 13,  hearts 5], [ clubs 6,  clubs 3,  diamonds 10,  spades 4,  hearts 2], [ diamonds 9,  spades 11,  hearts 6,  clubs 9,  hearts 14],
Player 3's hand: [ hearts 4,  hearts 10,  diamonds 8,  clubs 7,  diamonds 4], [ diamonds 6,  diamonds 3,  clubs 14,  spades 13,  hearts 5], [ clubs 6,  clubs 3,  diamonds 10,  spades 4,  hearts 2], [ diamonds 9,  spades 11,  hearts 6,  clubs 9,  hearts 14],
Player 4's hand: [ hearts 4,  hearts 10,  diamonds 8,  clubs 7,  diamonds 4], [ diamonds 6,  diamonds 3,  clubs 14,  spades 13,  hearts 5], [ clubs 6,  clubs 3,  diamonds 10,  spades 4,  hearts 2], [ diamonds 9,  spades 11,  hearts 6,  clubs 9,  hearts 14],

Nevertheless, it's obvious that substantial effort has gone into the poker game coding.
